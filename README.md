# Distributed_Web-Crawler
This repo will contain the contents of my distributed web crawler project (such as code, documwentation, etc). More to come! 


### What is a Web Crawler? 
* Indexes websites and extracts various types of 
data (ex: images, links, and so forth). 

### What is meant by "distributed"?  
* we can start by looking at a distributed system 
  * Distrubuted system can be thought of as a system of 
  independent computers (or nodes), which work together with other nodes by communicating with them (can be done though message passing or other means), in order 
  to work on a specific goal
