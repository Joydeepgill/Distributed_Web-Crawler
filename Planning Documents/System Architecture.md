â€‹														<u>**System Architecture**</u> 

- todo: Learn about the various components of a web crawler and how they work 
- todo: make a diagram (showing how the different systems interact with each other)

**Storage**

- Will need to somehow store extracted images from the webpages 

**Web Crawler/Spider** 

- the crawler will search through the webpages, getting the links leading to the next webpages and so on 

**Queue** 

- can contain the webpages that are yet to be crawled 

**Metadata**

- What? 
  - metadata contains information about data 
  - ex: date accessed, title and description, filename, etc. 
  - reference: https://dataedo.com/kb/data-glossary/what-is-metadata 
- can use a database to store metadata of the webpages that I've already visited in addition to the extracted images
